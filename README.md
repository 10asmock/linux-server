## HOW TO USE

### Logging in

Generally, most users need to access the server using ```ssh -i "linux-project.pem" ubuntu@ec2-52-14-242-245.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com```. However, for this project, I used the SSH client PuTTY and accessed my server by adding ```ubuntu@ec2-52-14-242-245.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com``` on ```Host Name (or IP address)``` found on the ```Session``` tab. Afterward, expand ```SSH``` --> ```Auth``` --> Click ```Browse``` and use the ssh key provided in this repository.
